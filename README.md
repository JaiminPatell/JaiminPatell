- âš¡ Fun fact: At 16, I freelanced as a graphic designer on Twitter, catching the attention of gaming YouTubers whom I collaborated with to create YouTube thumbnails. I didn't charge them; I did it for free as a fanboy of theirs, having followed their content. I'm skilled in Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and some 3D modeling tools like Blender and Autodesk.
